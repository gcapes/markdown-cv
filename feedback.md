## Training courses
- I enjoyed the course very much, I liked how Gerard did not assume people knew anything about this
  and really took us step by step through it.
  It was a lot and it will take time to process everything but I feel that thanks to the material available
  I am going to be able to do it confidently.
  Many thanks, it was great and super useful!
- Gerard was amazing.
  Even with zero previous knowledge on Git and Github and the content being quite dense,
  he managed to keep us engaged, has excellent material and the practical exercises were very useful to digest concepts
