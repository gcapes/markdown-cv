## Training courses
- I enjoyed the course very much, I liked how Gerard did not assume people knew anything about this
  and really took us step by step through it.
  It was a lot and it will take time to process everything but I feel that thanks to the material available
  I am going to be able to do it confidently.
  Many thanks, it was great and super useful!
- Gerard was amazing.
  Even with zero previous knowledge on Git and Github and the content being quite dense,
  he managed to keep us engaged, has excellent material and the practical exercises were very useful to digest concepts 
- VCS was one the most impressive workshops I have ever attended.
  The lecture was designed carefully and exerises were planned very constructively.
- It was a fantastic course that was nicely paced and I learnt a lot of new skills.
  I will now have to practice it!
  It was very good to have the story/common theme to link between examples.
  At the end of the day it was very easy to see how much progress had been made since 9am. Thank you!
