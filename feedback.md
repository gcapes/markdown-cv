# 2023 - 2024 Training courses
- I enjoyed the course very much, I liked how Gerard did not assume people knew anything about this
  and really took us step by step through it.
  It was a lot and it will take time to process everything but I feel that thanks to the material available
  I am going to be able to do it confidently.
  Many thanks, it was great and super useful!
- Gerard was amazing.
  Even with zero previous knowledge on Git and Github and the content being quite dense,
  he managed to keep us engaged, has excellent material and the practical exercises were very useful to digest concepts 
- VCS was one the most impressive workshops I have ever attended.
  The lecture was designed carefully and exerises were planned very constructively.
- It was a fantastic course that was nicely paced and I learnt a lot of new skills.
  I will now have to practice it!
  It was very good to have the story/common theme to link between examples.
  At the end of the day it was very easy to see how much progress had been made since 9am. Thank you!

“Gerard is a hardworking and knowledgeable colleague who is always helpful and is a tremendous asset to the team. As a good communicator, he excels at teaching Research IT Training courses which he does with enthusiasm and good humour. He has excellent problem solving skills and is meticulous when helping with a wide range of coding tasks which he is always able to solve accurately and efficiently.”
Tony Evans

"It has been good working with Gerard on the RoboTA project this year. As well as his contributions on the technical aspects, his support and good humour have been valuable in what has been a challenging project."

“Thank you for the GitHub tutorial today. One of the best tutorials (on anything) I've attended. Not a single typo or anything in the notes to confuse me and I always clearly knew what I should expect to see. Your lesson today really helped me to enjoy what GitHub has to offer and has made me less afraid to use it in the future.”
Matthew Roberts (CRUK)

“For the last year I have been a naive Linux user. My Linux box was built by an IT team who are more used to dealing with Windows, and it took several weeks to get it "sort of" working. Gerard was very helpful with this. More recently, when the continual stream of niggling problems got too annoying, he spent a few hours helping me to do a complete rebuild, since which time the machine has been behaving. I have found home always prompt and accurate with his help and advice.”
Helen Beaumont - Researcher

“Gerard came to my help when I was trying to learn how to use TeXstudio for the first time. I had a problem in that files would not compile, and the IT Help Desk people were not able to help so referred me to Gerard.  After making a couple of suggestions by email that did not work, Gerard offered to visit my office. He came and quickly identified the problem (with the way the software was configured) and corrected it, then stayed and gave me a rapid-fire TeXstudio tutorial. He was enormously helpful, listened to what I said I needed, and as a result I have gone from being utterly frustrated and despondent to seeing the way forward. I may now actually be able to get down to writing a paper instead of tearing my hair out over unfamiliar software. I am very grateful: this is what technical support should always be like.”
 Dr Adam Ozanne - Senior Lecturer

“Welcome! I'm so happy to hear you're joining us as a maintainer. The volume and quality of your contributions to the repo over the last year-plus have been legendary.”
Colin Morris – Software Carpentry Unix Shell lesson maintainer

“Gerard is the main organiser of the RIT training courses and delivers several of them. These are in high demand and regularly receive positive feedback. He cares about the student experience and has patiently facilitated my early teaching efforts.
I value Gerard's contribution to the RoboTA project, particularly the application of his git knowledge to student marking code. Between us we are making good progress.
Overall I have found Gerard to be a pleasure work with.”
Peter Crowther - Colleague


"I had the pleasure of working with Gerard to deliver online Carpentry
Instructor Training on July 25-26 2019. Although this was his first time
delivering this type of training, made even more difficult due to the
online nature of its delivery, I was thoroughly impressed with his
performance.

I found Gerard to be diligent and thorough regarding our preparations
for the event, and highly skilled and efficient in familiarising himself
with the training content and developing presentation material. Given
the complex nature of the material, his clear and engaging presentation
style was ideal for the course, and was clearly well received by the
learners.

Gerard was also very good in responding to questions about the material
and leading group discussions, and despite numerous technical issues
with conferencing technology which were beyond our control, he was able
to solve them or find good workarounds and keep to our agreed timing
schedule which is commendable. I look forward to any opportunities to
teach with him in the future!"
Steve Crouch – SSI, Carpentries Trainer

“Gerard has been developing Python code to automate marking of software engineering coursework at UG level. This has required him to learn several Python libraries, to interface with two main systems: the GitLab issue tracker and the Jenkins Continuous Integration server. Also, since the code needs to be reusable, it is necessary to use an object-oriented design that allows aspects of the code to be specific in text files (YAML format), so that changes to the behaviour of the marking system can easily be made. This has all necessitated quite a steep learning curve, but Gerard has tackled this head on. The code he has produced will be used extensively by around 240 UG students over the autumn, and will save a great deal of staff and TA time, as well as providing a unique learning environment for the students.”

Mark Johnson – rewrite MATLAB script to run as job array:
Gerard’s help was invaluable to allow me to analyse my data using the CSF. He responded quickly to my emails and explained everything clearly and concisely so even a layman, such as myself, could understand. He was always happy to help with any issues that arose and without his help I would not have been able to access the data processing facilities available.

Richard Fields – develop data back up utility, and teaching Git:
I approached Gerard approximately 3 months ago asking if we could look at developing automated data backup software for the NGI Energy Lab. He has been extremely helpful in this endeavour, his knowledge of python scripting and data management is particularly good. He has been an excellent sounding board for a number of ideas and is not afraid to clearly point out the pitfalls of different approaches; this has led us towards developing what will be a rather intuitive and functional piece of software.
He has also taught me quite a lot about the Git repository system, both during program development and also when I ultimately attended the Git training session. This has been very useful for my personal development and I though Gerard was an excellent teacher, the content he prepared was well thought out whilst the delivery was concise and clear.
Overall I find working with Gerard to be a pleasure, I would like to see him continue to develop his programming skills and assist in developing software for energy research at UoM.

Yu-Che Kao – MATLAB code debugging and development:
Thanks for assistance from Gerard who helps me a lot on writing matlab code.  He shows his patience to try to understand my study and problems on computer works. Also, he kindly explains the code to me again and again. On the other hand, I learn a lot out of his professional skills in matlab.  We had a couple of times to discuss together in my office in the past two months. It is really thankful to meet him when I need helps, otherwise I am still frustrating in work. It is a five-star assistance. Thank you a lot.

Thanh Bui – fault diagnosis with LaTeX installation:
I am a first year PhD student at GDI. I would like to use Latex to write up my thesis so I have participated in the “Introduction to LaTeX” course delivered by Dr Gerard Capes.  In general, the course was really useful with comprehensive contents. It is nicely structured with plenty of examples to learn by actually doing it. Like any other new software, you will always encounter some problem of running it at some point. Luckily, he introduces a number of popular error messages together with solutions beside several sources, where you could get help and find solutions by your own. Learning a new thing may be challenging, however, these detailed guidance would be really encouraging students like me to not giving up, given the result could be really fruitful (a beautiful thesis). Overall, after finishing the course, I get the idea of how Latex actually work such that I could use it for my own work independently.

In addition, I have some issue with Latex installation in my desktop after I download some new package for Beamer. It was broken down and could not function properly, which has bugged me for a while. Dr Gerard kindly checked on my desktop at my work place and figured out several problems. He was really enthusiastic to double check by a testing machine to make sure that it’s a technical problems rather than my own document. He then suggested the solution to the IT support team to reinstall both MiKteX and TeXstudio for me. Now it works well and I am able to do my work again. I cannot be more glad with his support.

Since the group was brought together in one location last May it has been much easier to engage and work with Gerard.  I find him to be well organised and he deals with customers and their enquiries in a very professional way.
He has been of particular help in relation to MATLAB, WRF/WRF-Chem, OpenFOAM and ABAQUS on the compute services.  When handling user enquiries or software installs Gerard always consults with our team about anything system related which he is unsure about rather than making assumptions and this is appreciated.

On the downside Gerard always seems to be very busy, so I am sometimes wary of asking him for help as I don't wish to disrupt his day to day work. Gerard often ends up acting as a 'man in the middle' between myself and Dassault Systems for ABAQUS related matters which is not an ideal way to operate.
